# Moja.ba

## MVP
The current implementation includes scalable user view mockup. The mockup can be found in the `src` folder. In the future, the system can be implemented as either a standalone application or a plugin to already-existing transit apps.

## System design
The data collection system will allow the city of Bratislava to collect more accurate usage and efficiency data regarding point-to-point transit, as well as transfer transit
